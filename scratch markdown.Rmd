```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
devtools::load_all()
status_study <- clindata::ctms_study


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
Make_Timeline(status_study)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
