Data are organized by snapshot date in the following way:

- `data/{SnapshotDate}/Mapped/`: contains one data file per mapped data domain
- `data/{SnapshotDate}/Analysis/{MetricID}/`: contains one or more data files per analysis data domain
- `data/{SnapshotDate}/Reporting/`: contains one data file per reporting data domain
