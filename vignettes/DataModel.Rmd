# Introduction

The `{gsm}` package provides a standardized data pipeline for conducting study-level Risk Based Quality Management (RBQM) for clinical trials. There are four main types of data used in `{gsm}`:  

- **Raw Data** - Clinical and operational data from study databases
- **Mapped Data** - Data that has been transformed and standardized for analysis
- **Analysis Data** - Data that has been analyzed to calculate Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
- **Reporting Data** - Data that has been summarized and formatted for reporting

This vignette provides a high-level overview of how each type of data is used, and includes detailed data specifications as appendices. 

# Data Model Overview 

In general, `{gsm}` is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users build custom data pipelines that support many types of raw study data. As shown below, raw clinical data is transformed into mapped data, which is then analyzed to calculate desired metrics. The analysis data is then combined and formatted for reporting with additional raw data, including CTMS data and `{gsm}` workflow data, which provides relevant metadata for reports.

# Raw and Mapped Data

`{gsm}` is designed to work with a wide variety of clinical data sources. The raw data used in the analysis pipeline is typically sourced from clinical trial databases and is transformed into mapped data using simple transformations. Mapped data is then used as input for the analysis pipeline. 

There is not a single data standard for raw or mapped data in `{gsm}`. The only requirement is that the mapped data is compatible with the analytics pipeline. Data Mapping transformations can be done using multiple methods including custom R scripts (e.g., with `dplyr`), SQL queries, or using `gsm` workflows (e.g. the `system.file("workflow/data_mapping.yaml", package = "gsm")` file). Examples of these methods can be found in the [Cookbook Vignette](Cookbook.html).

# Analysis Data 

In `{gsm}` analysis data is used to capture key metrics associated with the conduct of a clinical trial. As described in the `{gsm}` readme, 12 standard Key Risk Indicator (KRI) metrics are included in the package along with automated workflows that allow them to be run for all sites or countries in a study. Examples of KRIs include the rate of adverse events or amount of missing data at a site or across sites. Defining and deploying KRIs during continually monitor risks to the integrity of the trial and take corrective actions accordingly. 

![](data-analysis.PNG){width="100%"}

The image above provides an overview of the default KRI analysis pipeline. The pipeline is a standardized five-step process for assessing data issues by going from participant-level input data to a standardized site-level summary of model results. The functions used in each step of the data pipeline along with the input and output datasets are described in more detail below.

1.  `dfInput`: Input data; Cross-domain participant-level input data with all needed data for KRI derivation. Created by the `Input_Rate()` function used `mapped` data as input.
2.  `dfTransformed`: Transformed data; Site-level transformed data including KRI calculation. Created by `Transform_*()` functions using `dfInput` as input.
3.  `dfAnalyzed`: Analyzed data; Site-level analysis results data. Created by `Analyze_*()` functions using `dfTransformed` as input.
4.  `dfFlagged`: Flagged data; Site-level analysis results with flags added to indicate potential statistical outliers. Created by passing numeric thresholds to a `Flag_*()` function using `dfAnalyzed` as input.
5.  `dfSummary`: Summary data; Standardized subset of the flagged data. This summary data has the same structure for all assessments and always includes both KRI and Flag values so that a user can easily look at trends for any given site across multiple assessments. Created using the `Summarize()` function using `dfFlagged` as input.

The data requirements for each component of the analysis pipeline are rigid; See [Appendix 1](#Appendix-1-Data-Model) for full specifications.

## Analysis Workflows
Since there are rigid data requirements for each component of the analysis data model, the analysis workflow is largely standardized. There are two main approaches to running the analysis workflow:

1. **Scripted Analysis**: Run each step of the analysis pipeline individually using the functions provided in the `{gsm}` package. This approach is useful for understanding the data requirements and for debugging. See Example 1 in the [Cookbook Vignette](Cookbook.html) for an example of this approach.
2. **Workflow Analysis**: Run the analysis pipeline using a YAML workflow file. This approach is useful for running the same analysis on multiple studies or for automating the analysis process. See Example 2 in the [Cookbook Vignette](Cookbook.html) for an example of this approach.

Note that each step in these workflows can be customized based on the requirements for a specific KRI. The graphic below shows four such workflows.

More details about analysis data pipelines can be found in the [Analysis Deep Dive Vignette](DataAnalysis.html).

# Reporting Data 

A rigid Reporting Data framework is provided in {gsm} to allow for standardized reporting, visualization and meta-analysis that compare risk profiles across timepoints, and even across multiple studies.  The Reporting Data sets used in {gsm} are: 

1. `dfResults`: Summary data; Standardized subset of the flagged data. This summary data has the same structure for all assessments and always includes both KRI and Flag values so that a user can easily look at trends for any given site across multiple assessments. Created using the `Summarize()` function in the analytics pipeline, followed by the `BindResults()` function to add columns necessary for reporting and stack metrics and snapshots into a single data.frame.
3. `dfBounds`: Bounded data; A data.frame containing predicted boundary values with upper and lower bounds across the range of observed values. Created with the `MakeBounds()` function.
4. `dfGroups`: Grouped data; Long data.frame of summarized group CTMS data with site, study, and country level counts and metrics. Constructed by binding data.frames created with `MakeLongMeta()`.
5. `dfMetrics`: Metric metadata; Metric-specific metadata for use in charts and reporting. Created by passing an `lWorkflow` object to the `MakeMetric()` function.

Similar to Analysis Workflows, reporting data pipelines can be run as R scripts or as YAML workflows.  Example 3 in the cookbook vignette shows how to populate the Reporting Data tables using output from the Analysis Workflows and other study data sources. The Reporting Deep Dive Vignette provides more details on the Reporting Data model.

# Analytics data model

The KRI analytics pipeline is a standardized process for **Analyzing** data issues by going from participant-level `input` data to a standardized site-level `summary` of model results. The data sets used in each step of the data pipeline are described in detail below. When using a metric workflow yaml to create these tables, all data tables are contained in a list, which we call `lAnalysis`. This list is then fed into the reporting data pipeline.

## Appendix 2 - Analysis Workflow Specifications

Assessment workflow metadata objects are passed to the `lWorkflow` parameter in `RunWorkflow()` to define functions and parameters across multiple studies.

The `lWorkflow` object is a named list of metadata and steps defining how each assessment should be run. By default, `MakeWorkflowList()` imports YAML specifications from `workflow/metrics`. Each item in `lWorkflow` expects the following parameters in the `steps` section:

-   `workflow`: Array defining one or more functions to be executed as part of the workflow for a given assessment
    -   `workflow[]$meta`: specifies all of the metadata information for the KRI.
    -   `workflow[]$steps`: specifies all of the steps in the workflow.
        -   `workflow[]$steps$name`: name of the `{gsm}` function.
        -   `workflow[]$steps$inputs`: specifies the required input data
        -   `workflow[]$steps$output`: specifies the output data from the workflow step, which can be used as an input in the next step in the workflow
        -   `workflow[]$steps$params`: specifies parameters to be passed to the function

For example, the default workflow for the AE assessment (`system.file("workflow/metrics/kri0001.yaml", package = "gsm")`) is shown below:

```{yaml, code = readLines(system.file("workflow/metrics/kri0001.yaml", package = "gsm")), eval = FALSE}
```
