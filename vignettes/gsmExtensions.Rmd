# Overview

This vignette describes how to extend `gsm` by creating new "modules", including metrics, reports and shiny apps that be run using the standard `gsm` pipeline descibed in these vignettes (TODO: add link). As shown in the cookbook vignette (TODO: add link), the `gsm` data pipeline can be used to capture a monitoring 'snapshot' for a study that includes a variety of "modules" including metrics, reports and apps (TODO add links to AE KRI yaml, KRI Report and gsm.app). While some core modules are included in the `gsm` package while others can be added as extensions. This vignette provide detailed specifications for creating new modules and links to resources that can be used to configure study-level gsm pipelines that include these `gsm` extensions.

# Module Configuration

`gsm` modules will typically be part of an R package and have a YAML configuration file - `{module_name}.yaml` - saved under `\inst\workflows`. Module config files include 3 key properties: 

  -  `meta`: (required) Report metadata used for centralized library and fields referenced in `steps` section of workflow.
    - This is not required in the `{report_name}.yaml` if the report is entirely comprised of `metric`s that have their own `yaml` configuration files. 
  - `spec`: (required) Data table requirement for the report. Typically from `Mapped_*` or `Reporting_*` data, but occasionally from `Analytics_*` and `Reporting_*` data sources. 
  - `steps`: (required) Functions to produce the reporting output from `Mapped_*` and/or `Reporting_*` data to final output (`html`, `csv` or `shinyApp`).
   
Detailed specifications for each of these sections are provided below and links to several example module configuration files are provided at the end of this vignette (TODO: Add this). 

## Example Module Configuration YAMLs

Here are links to several sample module configuration files:

- [12 Standard gsm KRIs](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm/tree/dev/inst/workflow/metrics) (e.g. [Adverse Event KRI Metric](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm/tree/dev/inst/workflow/metrics/kri0001.yaml))
- [Site-](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm/blob/dev/inst/workflow/reports/report_kri_site.yaml) and [Country-level KRI Report](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm/blob/dev/inst/workflow/reports/report_kri_country.yaml)
- [GSM Deep Dive Shiny App]()

## `meta` Specification

The `meta` section of workflow YAML provides key metadata describing the module. It must include the following fields: 

- `Name`: Name of the reporting output.
- `Type`: "Report", "Metric" or "App"
- `ModuleID`/`MetricID`: The unique ID for the module. `ModuleID` is used for reports and apps, while `MetricID` is used for metrics.
- `Description`: A one-line description of the module specified in the workflow.
- `Details`: A more detailed description of the module specified in the workflow.
- `Repo`: Package repo and version. Should be compatible with the `repo` parameter in `devtools::install_github()`. 
- `Status`: The validation status of the reporting output. Valid values: 
    - `Qualified`: Output has been qualified via our qualification process specified [here](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm/articles/QualificationWorkflow.html). 
    - `Pilot`: Output is being used by pilot studies and is maintained in a package repository.
    - `Prototype`: Output is created using custom scripts on an ad-hoc basis.
    
Additional meta header required fields **apps** and **reports**: 

- `Permission`: Level of permissions for viewing that match the `Users` argument in the Study Config file. Common values: `Admin`, `Users`. (TODO: move this to "gsm.template")
- `Outputs`: The output of the workflow, including format.
- `ExampleURL`: Location of a sample report. Typically on the pkgdown site, ending with "/{ModuleID}.html".

Additional meta header required fields **metrics**:
- `GroupLevel`: The level at which the metric is calculated. Common values: `Site`, `Country`, `Region`, `Study`.
- `Abbreviation`: Abbreviation of the metric.
- `Metric`: Full name of the metric.
- `Numerator`: The numerator of the metric.
- `Denominator`: The denominator of the metric.
- `Model`: The model used to calculate the metric. Common values: `Normal Approximation`, `Exact`, `Bayesian`.
- `Score`: The score used to calculate the metric. Common values: `Z-Score`, `Adjusted Z-Score`, `P-Value`.


### `meta` example

A simple `meta` section for a report might look like this:
```
  File: report_example.yaml
  ModuleID: example_report
  Name: An example report
  Description: A report that is an example
  ModuleType: Report
  Repo: gsm.example v1.0.0
  Status: Qualified
  Permission: Users
  Outputs: An html report
  ExampleURL: https://gilead-biostats.github.io/gsm.example/example_report.html
```

## `spec` Specification

The `spec` section of the workflow YAML specifies the data requirements for the workflow, including the data tables that are required and the columns that are needed from each table. The `gsm` data pipeline is designed to be highly customizatble, but for the purposes of this vignette, we will assume usage of the standard `gsm` data model described in the [Data Model vignette](). For this standard use case, modules will pull primarily from the "Mapped" and "Reporting" data layers. 

The `spec` section of the workflow YAML is formatted as a list of data tables, with each table containing a list of columns. Finally, each column contains the following parameters:

- `required`: Boolean field specifying whether of not this column is required for the workflow to run, or optional/recommended for inclusion for user experience or augmented information. This parameter is required and must be included for all columns. 
- `type`: Character field describing the data type of the column. Use a `mode` as defined by R. This parameter is optional. 

### `spec` example: Metric Module

Metric `spec`s are typically pulled from the `mapped` data layer. For example, the `spec` section for the [AE KRI metric](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm/tree/dev/inst/workflow/metrics/kri0001.yaml) is: 

```
spec:
  Mapped_AE:
    subjid:
      required: true
      type: character
  Mapped_ENROLL:
    subjid:
      required: true
      type: character
    invid:
      required: true
      type: character
    timeonstudy:
      required: true
      type: numeric
```

So, in summary, the AE KRI metric requires two data tables, `Mapped_AE` and `Mapped_ENROLL`, both of which are from the mapped data layer. The `Mapped_AE` table must have a character Subject ID column called `subjid` while `Mapped_ENROLL` must have character Subject ID (`subjid`) and Investigator ID (`invid`) columns and a a numeric `timeonstudy` column. All columns are required for this metric. Note that other columns may be present in these tables (perhaps due to a `spec` from a differently module), but only the columns listed in the `spec` section are required for the metric to run.

### `spec` examples: Report Module

Report modules most often pull data from the `Reporting` data layer. For example, the [Site-level KRI report](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm/blob/dev/inst/workflow/reports/report_kri_site.yaml) has the following `spec`: 

```
spec:
  Reporting_Results: 
    _all:
      required: true
  Reporting_Groups:
    _all:
      required: false
  Reporting_Metrics:
    _all:
      required: false
  Reporting_Bounds:
    _all: 
      require: false
```

Note that the `_all` key word is used to specify that all standard columns from the `Reporting_Results` data table are expected and that the table required - without it, the report can't run. The other `Reporting` tables are used to enhance the report, but are not required.

The `Mapped` data layer is also available for use in reports and apps. Most typically, mapped data is used to drill down from high-level metric findings (e.g. "Site 5 has an elevated AE rate relative to other studies") to site- or participant- level details (e.g. "Participant 00016 from Site 5 had 5 AEs and 3 SAEs reported in the last 3 months."). For example, the [Deep Dive app]() includes both Reporting and Mapped data in its `spec`. Here is a representative exerpt from the `spec`:

```
spec:
  Reporting_Results: 
    _all:
      required: true
  Mapped_AE:
    subjid:
      required: false
      type: character
    aeterm:
      required: false
      type: character 
    aesev: 
      required: false
      type: character
    ...
```

## `steps` Specification

Finally, each module YAML config should have a `steps` property that describes in detail how the module is run. The `steps` section is a list of functions that are run in sequence to produce the final output. Each item in `steps` has the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the function to be run. This must be a function that is available in `{gsm}` package or in a package that is listed in the `repo` section of the `meta` header.
- `output`: The name of the output of the function. This is the name of the data table that is created by the function.
- `params`: A list of parameters that are passed to the function. The parameters are specific to the function that is being run. See below for more details on how to specify parameters for each function.

The `steps` is the most complex part of the module configuration and will vary greatly depending on the module type and the specific requirements of the module. `gsm` provides several functions that allow for module yaml files to be run in a standard way. See `?gsm::RunWorkflow()` for more details.

### `steps[]$params` Specification

After processing the YAML `meta` and `spec` sections, `gsm::RunWorkflow()` calls `gsm::RunStep()` for each step in the `steps` section of the YAML. The `params` section of each step is passed to `run_step()` as a list of parameters along with a copy of the metadata header (`lMeta`) and any data (`lData`). `RunStep()` then parses the list of `params` using the logic described below and passes the parsed parameters to the function specified in the `name` field of the step.

To parse the `params` list, each item is split in to `paramName` and `paramVal`. For example, `lData: Mapped_AE` is parsed to `paramName = 'lData'` and `paramVal = 'Mapped_AE'` and the following rules are applied in order: 

1. If `paramVal` is equal to "lMeta", the the full `lMeta` object is passed to the function (for the given `paramName`). 
2. If `paramVal` is equal to  "lData", the full `lData` object is passed to the function. 
3. If `paramVal` is found in `names(lMeta)`, that property is pulled from `lMeta` (e.g. `lMeta${paramVal}`) and passed to the function.
4. If `paramVal` is found in `names(lData)`, that property is pulled from `lData` (e.g. `lData${paramVal}`) and passed to the function.
5. Otherwise `paramVal` is passed to the function as a string.

## Types of Data Used in Workflows



Throughout this vignette, we will reference a variety of types of data, that all have fixed prefixes to identify their source and usage. Below, the five types of data are defined.

- `Raw_*`: Raw data table from g.dash, Raw+, edc, or other validated source.
- `Mapped_*`: Mapped data table that specifies and renames the columns needed from the `Raw_*` data for a given report.
- `Temp_*`: A temporary data table that is created by a step in a workflow and not saved externally. Typically used for custom filtering of data for particular metric analytics.
- `Analysis_*`: The output data tables of the `{gsm}` analytics workflow, specified in the [Analytics Workflow Vignette](LINK)
- `Reporting_*`: The output data tables of the `{gsm}` reporting workflow, specified in the [Reporting Workflow Vignette](LINK)
