\title{Fisher's Exact Test Analysis.}
\usage{
Analyze_Fisher(dfTransformed, strOutcome = "Numerator")
}
\arguments{
\item{dfTransformed}{\code{data.frame} Transformed data for analysis. Data should have one record per site with expected columns: \code{GroupID}, \code{GroupLevel}, \code{Numerator}, \code{Denominator}, and \code{Metric}. For more details see the Data Pipeline vignette: \code{vignette("DataPipeline", package = "gsm")}.
For this function, \code{dfTransformed} should typically be created using \code{\link[=Transform_Rate]{Transform_Rate()}}.}

\item{strOutcome}{\code{character} required, name of column in \code{dfTransformed}
dataset to perform Fisher's exact test on. Default is "Numerator".}
}
\value{
\code{data.frame} with one row per site with columns: GroupID, Numerator,
Numerator_Other, Denominator, Denominator_Other, Prop, Prop_Other, Metric,
Estimate, and Score.

\section{Statistical Methods}{


The function \code{Analyze_Fisher} utilizes \code{stats::fisher.test} to generate an
estimate of odds ratio as well as a p-value using the Fisher’s exact test
with site-level count data. For each site, the Fisher’s exact test is
conducted by comparing the given site to all other sites combined in a 2×2
contingency table. The p-values are then used as a scoring metric in
\code{{gsm}} to flag possible outliers. The default in \code{stats::fisher.test} uses
a two-sided test (equivalent to testing the null of OR = 1) and does not
compute p-values by Monte Carlo simulation unless \code{simulate.p.value = TRUE}. Sites with p-values less than 0.05 from the Fisher’s exact test
analysis are flagged by default. The significance level was set at a common
choice.
