#' Convenience function to easily run multiple workflows
#'
#' `r lifecycle::badge("stable")`
#'
#' This function takes a list of workflows and a list of data as input. If there
#' are multiple workflows in the list, it runs each workflow and returns the
#' results as a named list. If there is only one workflow, it runs that workflow
#' and returns the result.
#'
#' @param lWorkflows `list` A named list of metadata defining how the workflow should be run.
#' @param lData `list` A named list of domain-level data frames. Names should match the values specified in `lMapping` and `lAssessments`, which are generally based on the expected inputs from `X_Map_Raw`.
#' @param bKeepInputData `boolean` should the input data be returned? Default is `FALSE`.
#' @param bReturnData `boolean` should function return only bData or should meta and steps be included? Default is `TRUE`.
#'
#' @return A named list of results, where the names correspond to the names of
#' the workflows
