</h2>
<p>This vignette walks users through the mechanics of the
<code>Assess()</code> functions within the <a href="https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm" class="external-link">gsm</a> package.
<a href="https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm" class="external-link">gsm</a> leverages Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and thresholds
to conduct study-level and site-level Risk Based Monitoring for clinical
trials. The <code>Assess()</code> functions provide data frames,
visualization, and metadata to be used in reporting and error checking
at clinical sites. The image below illustrates the supporting functions
that feed into the workflow of the <code>Assess()</code> functions.</p>
<p><img src="data-analysis.PNG" style="width:100.0%"></p>
<p>All of these functions will run automatically and sequentially when a
user calls upon a given <code>Assess()</code> function.</p>
<p>Each of these individual functions can also be run independently
outside of an <code>Assess()</code> function.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this documentation, we will evaluate the input(s)
and output(s) of each individual function for a specific KRI to show the
stepwise progression of how <code>Assess()</code> handles and processes
data.</p>

<h3 id="case-study---step-by-step-adverse-event-kri">Case Study - Step-by-Step Adverse Event KRI<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#case-study---step-by-step-adverse-event-kri"></a>
</h3>
<p>We will use sample clinical data from the <code>{clindata}</code>
package to run the Adverse Events (AE) Assessment, i.e.,
<code><a href="../reference/AE_Assess.html">AE_Assess()</a></code>, using the Poisson statistical model.</p>
<p>Additional statistical methods and supporting functions are explored
in <a href="#appendix-1">Appendix 1</a>.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="create-dfinput">1. Create <code>dfInput</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-dfinput"></a>
</h4>
<p>Generating input data is outside the scope of the assessment pipeline
itself. However, the specifications for <code>dfInput</code> are
designed to be flexible enough so that this data frame can be generated
from multiple clinical data standards. For example, users can run the
<code>Map_Raw()</code> function, which will create <code>dfInput</code>
from Raw+ data.</p>
<p>The data frame <code>dfInput</code> for an AE assessment will be
created by running <code><a href="../reference/AE_Map_Raw.html">AE_Map_Raw()</a></code> and will have one record
per subject, with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>SubjectID</code> = Subject Identifier</li>
<li>
<code>SiteID</code> = Site Identifier</li>
<li>
<code>StudyID</code> = Study Identifier</li>
<li>
<code>CustomGroupID</code> = Custom Group Identifier (in this
example, set to Country ID)</li>
<li>
<code>Exposure</code> = Total Time on Treatment (measured in days;
per subject)</li>
<li>
<code>Count</code> = Total Number of Event(s) of Interest (in this
example, the number of AEs reported; per subject)</li>
<li>
<code>Rate</code> = Rate of Event Incidence (calculated as
<code>Exposure</code>/<code>Count</code>; per subject)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="create-dftransformed">2. Create <code>dfTransformed</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-dftransformed"></a>
</h4>
<p>The data frame <code>dfTransformed</code> is derived from
<code>dfInput</code> using a <code>Transform()</code> function. In our
example, the analysis pipeline pulls in <code><a href="../reference/Transform_Rate.html">Transform_Rate()</a></code>
since the default metric for AEs is the number of AEs reported over the
course of treatment per site, i.e., a rate.</p>
<p>The resulting <code>dfTransformed</code> data frame will contain
site-level transformed data, including KRI calculation. Using our
example AE data, <code>dfTransformed</code> contains the following
columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GroupID</code> = Group Identifier (default is Site ID)</li>
<li>
<code>Numerator</code> = Cumulative Number of Event(s) of Interest
(in this example, number of AEs reported across subjects)</li>
<li>
<code>Denominator</code> = Cumulative Time on Treatment (in days,
across subjects)</li>
<li>
<code>Metric</code> = Rate of Event(s) of Interest (in this example,
number of AEs reported over the course of treatment in days)</li>
</ul>

<p>The data frame <code>dfAnalyzed</code> is derived from
<code>dfTransformed</code> using an <code>Analyze()</code> function,
which incorporates a specific statistical model. The resulting
<code>dfAnalyzed</code> data frame will contain site-level analysis
results data. The Poisson model is the default statistical model for AE
data, so the analysis pipeline automatically runs
<code><a href="../reference/Analyze_Poisson.html">Analyze_Poisson()</a></code>. Using our example AE data,
<code>dfAnalyzed</code> contains the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GroupID</code> = Group Identifier (default is Site ID)</li>
<li>
<code>Numerator</code> = Cumulative Number of Event(s) of Interest
(in this example, number of AEs reported across subjects); Carried from
<code>dfTransformed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Denominator</code> = Cumulative Time on Treatment (in days,
across subjects); Carried from <code>dfTransformed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Metric</code> = Rate of Event(s) of Interest (in this example,
number of AEs reported over the course of treatment in days); Carried
from <code>dfTransformed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Score</code> = Calculated Residual (per site)</li>
<li>
<code>PredictedCount</code> = Calculated Predicted Count (per
site)</li>

</h4>
<p>The data frame <code>dfFlagged</code> is derived from
<code>dfAnalyzed</code> using a <code><a href="../reference/Flag.html">Flag()</a></code> function. The
resulting <code>dfFlagged</code> data frame will contain site-level
analysis results data with flagging incorporated based on a
pre-specified statistical threshold to highlight possible outliers. The
default flagging function for the AE Poisson model is
<code><a href="../reference/Flag_Poisson.html">Flag_Poisson()</a></code> and the default threshold is (-7, -5, 5, 7)
based on the available literature. Using our example AE data,
<code>dfFlagged</code> contains the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GroupID</code> = Group Identifier (default is Site ID)</li>
<li>
<code>Numerator</code> = Cumulative Number of Event(s) of Interest
(in this example, number of AEs reported across subjects); Carried from
<code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Denominator</code> = Cumulative Time on Treatment (in days,
across subjects); Carried from <code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Metric</code> = Rate of Event(s) of Interest (in this example,
number of AEs reported over the course of treatment in days); Carried
from <code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Score</code> = Calculated Residual (per site); Carried from
<code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>PredictedCount</code> = Calculated Predicted Count (per site);
Carried from <code>dfAnalyzed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Flag</code> = Flag Indicating Possible Statistical Outliers;
Valid values for this variable include -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, which
determine the “extremeness” of the outlier. -2 and 2 represent more
extreme outliers, -1 and 1 represent less extreme outliers, and 0
represents a non-outlier.</li>

<p>The data frame <code>dfSummary</code> is derived from
<code>dfFlagged</code> using the <code><a href="../reference/Summarize.html">Summarize()</a></code> function. The
resulting <code>dfSummary</code> data frame will contain the most
relevant columns from <code>dfFlagged</code> with data sorted in a
meaningful way to provide a concise overview of the assessment. Flagged
sites will sort earlier than non-flagged sites, with the more “extreme”
outliers displayed first. The columns in <code>dfSummary</code>
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>GroupID</code> = Group Identifier (default is Site ID)</li>
<li>
<code>Metric</code> = Rate of Event(s) of Interest (in this example,
number of AEs reported over the course of treatment in days)</li>
<li>
<code>Score</code> = Calculated Residual (per site)</li>
<li>
<code>Flag</code> = Flag Indicating Possible Statistical Outliers;
Valid values for this variable include -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, which

<h4 id="data-visualization">6. Data Visualization<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-visualization"></a>
</h4>
<p>Data visualizations are built into each <code>Assess()</code>
function/KRI. For a Poisson AE assessment, a scatter plot of Total
Exposure (in days, on log scale) vs Total Number of Event(s) of Interest
(on linear scale) is created. Each data point represents one site with
outliers displayed in yellow or red, depending on the “extremeness” of
the KRI value. The <code><a href="../reference/Visualize_Scatter.html">Visualize_Scatter()</a></code> function takes
inputs of <code>dfTransformed</code> to define bounds and
<code>dfFlagged</code> to plot the data. Using our example AE data, we
see the following scatter plot:</p>
